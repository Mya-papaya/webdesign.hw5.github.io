# Reflection on Painting I & Painting II

## My Favorite Class: Painting I & Painting II

One of my favorite classes I took was **Painting I** and **Painting II**. These courses not only helped me develop my artistic skills but also significantly boosted my confidence in my abilities as an artist. 

In **Painting I**, I started from scratch, learning the basics of painting techniques, color theory, and brushwork. I remember feeling overwhelmed at first, but as the semester progressed, I began to trust my creative instincts more. 

When I moved into **Painting II**, I was challenged to push my boundaries and experiment with new styles and mediums. This class pushed me to think outside the box, resulting in a lot of personal growth. The feeling of accomplishment after completing each painting gave me the confidence to explore more advanced projects, and I began to believe in my abilities as an artist.

The combination of technical learning and personal expression made these courses stand out to me. I look back at my work from those classes and see how much Iâ€™ve grown, both as an artist and as a person. The confidence I gained in those classes has continued to influence my work and how I approach new challenges.
