    <h1>My Website Ideas</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website ideas page! Below are a few concepts I’m considering developing for my project.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Sustainable Eats</h2>
        <p>On this website, I want to focus on creating delicious, sustainable recipes that help minimize food waste. It will feature plant-based meals, zero-waste cooking tips, and sustainable sourcing suggestions for ingredients. The tone will be welcoming and eco-conscious, encouraging people to make mindful choices when it comes to food.</p>

        <h2>Local Immersion Travel</h2>
        <p>This travel blog will be dedicated to exploring destinations in a way that goes beyond typical tourist attractions. I aim to connect with locals, learn about their traditions, and immerse myself in the culture. The tone will be authentic and immersive, with an emphasis on experiencing the world in a meaningful way.</p>

        <h2>Art Through Emotion</h2>
        <p>This portfolio website will showcase my personal artwork while sharing the emotions and stories behind each piece. I’ll focus on how art is a reflection of human experiences, and the website will allow visitors to understand the meaning and journey behind the work. The tone will be introspective and personal, drawing visitors into the emotional side of my creations.</p>

        <h2>Urban Green Spaces</h2>
        <p>This website will center around urban gardening and small-space green living. I’ll share tips on how to grow plants in apartments or small city spaces, along with resources for people who want to bring nature into their urban environments. The tone will be calming and practical, encouraging people to incorporate plants into their everyday lives.</p>
